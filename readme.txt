Hello!

Some information on the developer test

You can take this design as far as you want functionality wise (front end only and time permitting of course!) and feel free to include any JS/jQuery plugins you see fit to achieve that.

What we will not accept is solutions created from CSS/HTML frameworks. The core HTML created and styling should be your own. With responsive breakpoints added to style correctly for mobile.

There are some links to the required fonts and style guide below. The style guide should have all the information you need for all aspects of the design.

Fonts -

League Spartan - https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/league-spartan

Poppins - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins

We’ve also included less.js to allow you to work with that locally should you need to. Applying styling to the styles.less file within the styles folder if you wish to use Less. Be aware though due to a known issue it won’t work in chrome, so use another preferred browser if going down this route! If you are to not use LessCSS you can add standard CSS to the siteStyle.css file within the styles folder

Need any further documentation on less.js you can find it here: http://lesscss.org/

Once you have completed the exercise could you submit your work via https://wetransfer.com/ - uploading a zip folder for your project creation. This will be reviewed and we shall provide feedback. Please send this to linda.haydock@simpleviewinc.com

Many thanks and Good Luck!
